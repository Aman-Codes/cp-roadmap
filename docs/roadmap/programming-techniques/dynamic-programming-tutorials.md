## Basic Dynamic Programming

1. Watch [DP video by Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBSt1jYwVfU)
2. Read [hackerearth article for DP](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/introduction-to-dynamic-programming-1/tutorial/)

:::tip

**Note**: For visualising recursion tree of common problems like finding Fibonacci number, coin change problem, etc. you may use [Recursion Tree Visualisation](https://recursion.now.sh/). Observe that DP can be applied only when there are **overlapping subproblems**.

## 2-D Dynamic Programming

1. Read [hackerearth article on 2-D Dynamic Programming](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/2-dimensional/tutorial/)
2. Watch [Video on "Coin change" (double counting) problem by Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mtvm2ubHCY)
3. Watch [Video on "Line of wines" problem by Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpOC1dph6U)

## State Space Reduction

1. Read [hackerearth article on state space reduction](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/dynamic-programming/state-space-reduction/tutorial/)

:::tip

You must take care of time limit and especially memory limit while using DP. Often problems are framed in such a way that it wants you to use your memory smartly.
