## Bitwise operations and Bitmasks

### Tutorials

1. Go through [this CF blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73490) for an idea of the bitwise operations and the concept of bitmasks.

2. Go through [this CF blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73558) for understanding __builtin_popcount() function and bitsets
