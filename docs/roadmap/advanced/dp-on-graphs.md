## DP on Graphs

:::tip

Make sure you know the basics of graphs, DFS, topological sorting, SCC and DP before moving towards this section. 

:::

1. Read the sections 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 18.1 and 18.3 from [CPH book](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf#page=161) to understand DP on graphs, successor / functional graphs and binary lifting.

2. Go through the algorithm for finding LCA of two nodes in any tree using binary lifting and binary search from [here](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/lca_binary_lifting.html)

## Session slides

1. [Day 1 - DP on graphs, DP on directed graph with cycles, successor/functional graphs, binary lifting, Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (Hare and tortoise algorithm) for successor graphs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14w8FzqCl4kgYeOVxFoWsO3VkLKTIiUo9nvMz6JCQmmM/edit#heading=h.vf6ljt10081x)

## Additional Resource

1. If you want to learn more about DP on trees, through some problems, you can refer [this CF blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/20935)
